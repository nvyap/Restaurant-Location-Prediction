      "I would definitely recommend. The restaurant has not atmosphere and is cool and trendy. I had the burger with havarti cheese and bacon - Delish! The burger was moist and juicy and the bread it came on was so fresh and tasty. I also had the grilled asparagus, but did not really like it served cold, so next time may ask that they heat it up. All in all, it is a must try. fxU4mWGl2-FLUhd5W4ncUg\n",
      "Great service from all and a really fun atmosphere. Honestly we came to play ping pong and enjoy a few drinks but decided to order dinner. I sampled the shaved prime rib dip sandwich that a friend ordered, it was very nice with perfectly rosey prime rib. I loved my pub burger and fries. Fries were hot, crispy and flavorful and my burger was one of the best I've had. Next time we go to the valley we know where we'll eat. -s0jRzP3HGflL8ckXQYUEA\n",
      "I'm not planning to come back, but wouldn't say no if someone else wanted to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've visited twice now with mixed experiences. I thought the food was as expected from a Fox restaurant. Not exactly to die for, but definitely better than a Chili's. My aversion to loving this spot is the menu prices and the extreme wait during a lunch \"hour\", and I use the term hour loosely there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had I not been out to lunch with my boss already, I would have likely had a stern \"talking to\" when I got back to the office two hours later. We had six people at our table and took about five or so minutes to peruse the menu. The staff was quick to deliver our drinks, but four salads, a burger, a meatloaf and 50 minutes later meant my lunch hour turned into a lunch two hour. I didn't exactly expect a ten minute turn around on our food; but really, almost an hour to deliver these dishes is seriously extreme. Even though my boss was with me, by the end of our lunch I was itching to get back to the office as to not waste any more time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The burger I ordered was on the menu at $12, not exactly cheap to begin with. The waitress asked if I would like fries or a salad with it, but I asked if there was a vegetable I could have instead and she was happy to bring it out with asparagus. Regrettably, she failed to mention an added charge to make that swap from spuds to veg. My $12 burger, now $18 after fees, tax, and tip, is why I usually skip lunches during the week and bring in my own from home. :-(\n",
      "\n",
      "I did; however, like the food itself, the company, the location, and the waitress was nice enough as well as apologetic about the long wait. I like the LARGE outdoor patio complete with shuffle board, corn hole, ping pong, and foosball. Seems like it could be a fun place to come for drinks in the evening hours with a couple of work buddies.\n",
      "\n",
      "On my previous visit, I had the meatloaf, the meatloaf itself was good - and I did really enjoy the green beans, but not awesome and not really worth the price IMO, especially when adorn with what can only be described as fancy ketchup, really, ketchup on a $16 meatloaf (after tax-tip). Honestly, I feel the food on the menu is priced about 20% too high for most of the items. I wouldn't mind returning for happy hour, but outside of that, I'll likely just stick to \"grabbing a drink\" or two with friends if I'm ever back. 9OSySQgbFQPF6CK9aZnSMQ\n",

The place is big enough to accommodate large groups has shuffleboard bean bags photo booth table tennis to entertain everyone.. Cocktails are nice but not light liquor imo...food is good pretzel balls are fun chicken meatballs are tasty... The mussels and toast is also a good  choice... I think entree wise I've probably had the western burger and the most often.... Valet is convenient and cheap good selection of beers on tap and liquor options...

      "11 of us ( and a toddler) came here today to celebrate a birthday. I had the grilled chicken club and it was DELICIOUS!! Others in our party had: turkey pastrami sandwich, pub burger, salmon kale salad, and French dip. And all said they were very very good. We also had to have the pretzels and fondue cheese for an appetizer. It was good but I wish the cheese had maybe some spice, jalapeño maybe?, to it as it was kind of bland. We came at 2pm and it was still really busy but we were able to snag a cornhole game. The only bad things I have to say is our server forgot some things when we asked for them special but it was busy and there were 11 of us with only one server. And I'm guessing he was a manager but another guy that was bringing out food was quite rude when THEY had messed up one of our guests orders. Other than that we will definitely be back, the food was great! 5gIMoog2F9vn5j-1EZExpA\n",
      "Fiance and I wanted to take her aunt somewhere to celebrate her birthday...Beautiful day as always here in AZ so we wanted some outdoor dining...Found this place on YELP and WOW!! This place is so modern yet so relaxing, with a fun enviorment. Very well put together, nice full bar, area to play ping pong, and bags!? Cant say how much we loved it. Had a Belgium beer on tap. Great beer...Food was excellent, i had the Italian Sandwhich...very good, fiance had the beer battered fish. Very good as well, and her aunt had a burger which looked very BIG and good as well. Servers were very pretty and dressed very \"hipsterish\" according to my fiance...i just thought they looked very well dressed and beautiful girls...No dress code...I will be back soon...i do want to visit the Scottsdale one and see the difference in the people. Oh and i almost forgot...They have complementary valet VIP parking..just pull up and slide the kid a few singles on the way out. mILprS7017aB9mDuAeJeyA\n",
      "Last weekend we took friends from Dallas, in town for spring training and sat outside. Fire pits, live music, ppl watching, cool beers, all good. We tried the 'cheese cracklings' as one of our appetizers and they were very different & good!  Meatloaf, fish n chips, a burger and the pastrami sandwich, again all good. \n",
      "So this weekend we have a good friend in from Stanford and before today's game we are headed in for (1st time) brunch! Hope it's as good! We'll see... ...such a cool concept! 38Bb_WCfI-sy1GQrqY1Ivg\n",
      "No wonder their name it culinary dropout. No problen living up to their title. Frozen food. You might as well go ti mcdonalds for a big mac Instead of having their Mac burger. Absolutely horrible food. Beer overpriced. Careless waitresses. Managers are useless but never helpful. Theres a hundres other restaurants much better in a milr radius wcuxpvHVjNiBMa7GLeUXnA\n",
      "We were out in AZ for my brother's graduation, which meant he got to pick the place to celebrate.  He recommended Culinary Dropout for our large group (2 other families celebrating with us).  The cliff notes version is he chose wisely.\n",
      "\n",
      "We sampled nearly all the apps.  The deviled eggs were simple, but probably my favorite.  We split the grilled cheese sliders as well.  A few of us enjoyed the special kale salad they had, while the rest went large with the either the pub burger or pastrami.  The salads came in good portions and were full of flavor.  Those going with the sandwiches didn't leave anything on their plates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, we also enjoyed a few drinks.  Some seemed a bit pricy, but they came quick and it was a day to celebrate.  I tried the After School Special beer cocktail and was happy with my choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the meal was complete, a few of us stuck around to play some games and enjoy the atmosphere.  I could see myself frequenting this place if I lived in the area.  Therefore, from a tourist perspective, I say go for a visit. BncdSs4hc91ZfJzCh-Rwkg\n",
      "If a restaurant could suffer from schizophrenia, Culinary Dropout would certainly get such a diagnosis. The service and food have both been inconsistent. The place holds itself out as a bar, but the game area is constantly overrun with children whose parents use the game as a substitute for watching their children.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first time I went for brunch, the place was packed, but my friend and I were able to snag a seat at the bar. It took forever for the bartender to acknowledge us and get our drink order, and even longer to place a food order. The breakfast burrito I had was really good, especially the potatoes that came with it. My friend opted for the basic eggs, bacon, and toast breakfast. When her food came, she asked if they had any jam for the toast. The waiter said she wasn't sure and would check. How can you serve toast and not have jelly? Makes no sense. Fortunately, they did have some freshly made strawberry preserves that were really delicious. \n",
      "\n",
      "Drink prices are also pretty steep. $6.50 for a 16 oz for an Oskar Blues Pale Ale? I can go to Windsor and have a pitcher to myself for $7, and $5 if it's happy hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had an early brunch a few weeks later and had no problem getting a table outside. I opted for the breakfast burrito again, but it wasn't as good this time. My boyfriend had the Captain Crunch Crusted French Toast, which sounded really good, but it was actually pretty bland. Our server was also just okay, which was disappointing because we were one of the only tables there.\n",
      "\n",
      "My best experience was on a Thursday night. We got a great spot at one of the couches on the patio, and for the first time, I had great service here! Our waitress was awesome and never let our drinks get empty. She even put up with our drunken (annoying) party with a smile. And the Sweet Corn Cannelloni dish we ordered was excellent!\n",
      "\n",
      "I came again yesterday for a late lunch. There was no problem getting a table, even though it was Memorial Day. Despite the fact that it wasn't that crowded, our waiter was pretty MIA. All of our drinks went empty at one point, and I would have definitely ordered another beer if he had bothered to ask. Thankfully, the food was excellent! We shared an order of grilled cheese sliders, and then I had the fried chicken because calories don't count on a 3-day weekend. My entree was amazing, and the portion was huge! I had a solid amount of food to take home for lunch today. My boyfriend said his double cheeseburger was great, evidenced by the fact that he didn't offer me a bite.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although I enjoy gambling, I don't like to do it with my restaurant experiences. Until Culinary Dropout can become more of a sure bet, it won't be my first choice for dining in the area. \n",

      "I am from Wisconsin and was visiting a friend who moved to Phoenix awhile back. We had driven by The Yard during the day and thought it looked like an interesting place to check out. Later that night when we did, we were not disappointed! I loved how big the bar was-made it easy to find a spot and get some drinks. The bartender was kind and professional and he refilled our drinks in a timely manner. My friend's boyfriend ordered a burger-which he loved. After a few drinks we ventured to The Yard portion of the establishment. I love how you can bring your drinks over to play bags, fooseball, ping pong...you name it. They had a photobooth which was utilized quite a few times. Overall, Culinary Dropout was a great time! I kept telling my friends that I wish Wisconsin had a similar restaurant. Check them out! goGg2hqORM1-jN5NR1Knyw\n",
      "Came here for a work event. Honestly, the food was alright. Not the biggest fan of their main dishes, which included mini burgers, nachos, and wings. However, am definitely a big fan of their dessert. Their banana cream pie is honestly so great and would recommend.\n",

      "Our server, Grace, was awesome. She kept coming to check if everything was alright, always had a smile, and made my sister and I feel welcomed.  \n",

      "\n",
      "We walk in and are told about 20 minute wait...not bad.  They text u when the table is ready, which I loved.  Once we sat this is when everything is downhill.  The server was obviously extremely overwhelmed and busy.  We are understanding people,  so we waited.  First he comes over and says \"I'll just get everyone waters\"....well ok then, guess water it is.  He eventually came back...got our drink order and then off he goes.  We did stop him to order apps...which is a whole story.  After waiting 40 minutes and the people who sat after us got their apps we decided to ask.  Mind you at this time we already have ordered our food.  He forgot the  apps....great!! 4 hungry adults and a starving kid...no food 40 minutes in.  Finally food shows up after complaining about it.  The pretzel fondue was delicious.  The chips and famous onion dip were ok.  But the star was the deviled eggs with prosciutto were a show stopper!!!  Amazing!! I will come back just for those little babies!\n",
      "\n",
      "1 hour and 7 minutes...FOOD comes!!!  Hmmm...majority was good.  I personally got the turkey pastrami....this burger has a identity crisis.  Majority of pastrami sandwhiches I have had are hot.  This came out with melted cheese on top and looked delicious.  Took one bite and ice cold in the middle.  Seriously ice cold!  Ask the server if it's a hot or cold sandwhich, his response \"half hot and half cold\"  Are you kidding me?!?!?!  At this point I am annoyed!  Husband ordered fish and chips.  Fish was awesome!! Everyone else ordered burgers and there were no complaints.  Overall the food was decent...but service was miserable. The guy tried...but was a epic fail at the end.  Overall the dinner trip was over a hour and a half....not sure that's worth it.... HY3utppwLf_hmHdy7kA3VQ\n",
      "Sooooooo(oooooo...) delicious!\n",
      "\n",
      "I came with a pal and his 3-year old daughter. Clearly, this isn't a super child-friendly place, but everyone - our waitress, the other waiters and waitresses, the hostesses, and the kitchen staff - did everything within their power to accommodate the wee one...including making a chocolate milk from scratch.  Ridiculous, and it got applause from the kiddo!\n",
      "\n",
      "Being at the pre-opening, we had the opportunity to try a lot of different things...like a gross amount of food.  I'm not exactly proud of how much I ate.\n",
      "\n",
      "We started with the crusty bread and oil, prosciutto (a HUGE pile), another pork meat I can't recall, manchego and prairie breeze cheeses.  While eating them, I wondered why our server didn't tell us which meat was which...and then we noticed they are actually written on the plate paper liner.  Duh....\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the \"healthy\" salmon entree, which was cooked to perfection and the farro, cooked apple and fennel side flavorful enough that I wouldn't immediate think it was super healthy.   My buddy wanted the Korean Ribeye Cap but it was not available (noted on the menu that it has extremely limited availability), so he got the pork ribs instead.  It was a TON of food again, with a side of cole slaw that I ate.  For kids, we were given the option of grilled cheese sliders, burger sliders, mac n cheese, and chicken tenders, so slightly more options than I'd expect for a not-so-kid-friendly type of place.\n",

      "My pal had the Bacon Bloody Mary and guzzled 2 of those.  I had only 1 cocktail - the Maria Pepino, which is basically a bloody mary with tequila instead of vodka, and garnished with a pickled pepper.  It was the perfect blend of savory tomato, spice, and acid.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only \"misses\" for me was the iced tea (no one has plain iced tea anymore...no biggie, but please freaking tell me it's some nasty sweet shit) and the monkey bread, which was overly sweet and had a ton of apples that we picked around.\n",

      "Our bill was an astronomical $110+ for lunch...which included 3 cocktails, a few appetizers, 3 entrees, and a dessert.  Would I be back for the whole she-bang?  Hell no...unless it's another gratis meal.  But will I be back for the sweet patio and a great cocktail and apps?  Most definitely!\n",

      "Lots of parking in the back.  Clean restrooms, but odd how they're set up... They are outside of the main restaurant portion, with separate doors for Men and Women.  But both doors take you to the communal sinks.  Why not just have one door to the restrooms?  \n",

We had their pretzel fondue, which was fabulous,  and had bacon burgers, and fries and everything was great! The waiter James was very attentive, as well as the manager on duty, James Lee. I would highly recommend this spot. It has a trendy decor, and really friendly staff! Rpm9h6usb918rbzN75kAog\n",
      "I tried the After School Special with modelo beer & a turkey pastrami sandwich/burger with pretzel buns. It had a slaw + horse radish in it and was served with a pickle a side of salad (you could have chosen chips or french fries). They have different salad dressing toppings but I went with champagne vinaigrette which tasted nice and light. I tried the chicken and waffles with biscuit and mashed potato and thought the chicken was cooked perfectly. It wasn't overly salty or overly cooked. The meat was moist and tender. The pretzel bun on my sandwich was super unique but filling. They had a live band play tonight called Vinyl Station. They played awesome cover songs including some songs by Oasis, Beatles, Cold Play and Black Keys. Our waitress was friendly/cool and the manager comp'd us on the chicken because no 1 actually ordered the chicken. They left out our fish and chips order on accident but it didn't take long for them to whip it up. The tartar sauce was perfect and the fish was great. I'd come back here again with friends for sure. The space is super hip, well decorated and fun. Music can be loud so conversing can get difficult. ZSGyNur945skbvcHs9zPtw\n",
      "I loved this whole scene. It very much reminded me of The Block, Brewster's and Lagunitas in Petaluma. The food was really, really good. We tried the pretzel bites with cheese dips, the burgers, a chopped salad with cous cous and a menu item called yesterday's soup. Which was a great add to a menu. It was the day before soup of the day at a lower price. You don't often see that. \n",
      "The service was spot on and we really enjoyed the experience. Oh and the artisan cocktails were really good and a hefty beer and wine list. vfbH8ZZHCCkeI65KYxOmBw\n",
      "First timer today & was not disappointed! In fact, this place is my cup of tea.  The food was more than perfect, the service was incredible, and the setup is ideal for a good time.  We had the pretzel with fondue, fried chicken, & pub burger with a side of onion sauce.  *deep sigh*  The pub burger with the onion sauce is the best burger I've ever had.  Ever. We will definitely be back for some Giant Jenga & Foosball. qHbGPN1iEil8t2g8cTJMnw\n",
      "We went there for dinner with my niece and nephew and their families while visiting Phoenix last weekend. Good food at reasonable prices. My spouse and I split a burger and a chicken entrée salad, and both were really good, although the salad was a little shy on the chicken.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered an old fashioned (my favorite cocktail), and they did it right: No muddling or splash of seltzer water, just bourbon, bitters, an orange peel and a Luxardo cherry (not one of those highly processed neon cherries) on ice. But it was a little watered down. My guess is the bartender made our drinks and they sat too long with the ice melting before our server brought them to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Loved The Yard, with games like ping pong and Foosball. I played with my niece's and nephew's kids until an employee came up and told me that kids aren't allowed in The Yard after 6 p.m. Really? Not even with adult supervision? That kinda sucked. They had to go back to the table and watch other people play games they wanted to play.\n",

      "I had the opportunity to visit Culinary Dropout at The Yard earlier this year as part of a Yelp Elite event and I have been looking forward to coming back ever since. If you've never been to The Yard, then you need to check it out. Located in Central Phoenix close to Missouri and 7th Street, The Yard offers three distinct restaurants and a common patio area - a GREAT place to hang out with friends. On this recent visit, I took a small group of customers there for lunch. While I was leaning towards Barrio Urbano (SO amazing!) one of the guys in our group had just had Mexican food so we decided on Culinary Dropout. We were glad with the choice!\n",
      "\n",
      "We started off with a few small bites: brussels sprouts, roasted beets, and truffle cheddar potato chips. The brussels sprouts were perfect roasted with a nice char on the outside. The beets were small cubes served with light balsamic finish. They  had a deep, earthy flavor that hit the spot. The chips were also very good, crisp and salty with shaved cheese on top (can't go wrong with that!) All in all, the snacks were very good - only $3 each but a little on the small side. I'm glad we got them all as starters.\n",
      "\n",
      "For my lunch, I went with the seared tuna salad, a large bowl of greens served up with a light ginger vinaigrette, cashews and crunchy wasabi peas, topped with petite, delicate seared ahi medallions. The smooth taste of the tuna mixed with the fresh greens and dressing (with the occasional crunch) was wonderful and I was very satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sandwiches also looked very good. One of my customers ordered the chicken club and it looked like a monster bacon cheeseburger with a grilled chicken breast in lieu of a beef patty. Cheese was oozing down all sides and it looked amazing. I might need to try that next time!\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are in the Central Phoenix area and are looking for a cool place to hang out and enjoy some great gastro-pub fare, then look no further than Culinary Dropout at The Yard!\n",

      "The Culinary Dropout was recommended by a friend and is a Fox Restaurant Concept, generally known for more upscale type establishments.  The atmosphere at Culinary Dropout  is really trendy and cool, even our server had a cool name \"Slade\". We decided to eat outside in order to avoid a wait and to take advantage of one of the rare occasions when you can eat on the patio in Phoenix, Arizona, in August.\n",
      "\n",
      "My friends and I were famished, so we opted to order some of the house-made potato chips and the pretzels with provolone fondue.  Both of these appetizers were excellent.  I couldnt get enough of the pretzels, and if I hadn't had an entree coming, I probably would have polished off the whole order by myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an entree I ordered the chicken club sandwich which came with a chicken breast, ham and bacon.  It was quite good.  My lunch companions had the meatloaf, fried chciken, and mac & cheese burger and they were equally delicious.\n",

      "The service was perfect-our server was friendly and there at the right time every time.  We will definitely come back again. cNH1vk3kC0E4NV7F6lFBJw\n",
      "This place was a lot more casual than I expected. The food was good but the portions were small and pricey. The burger was not filling and a breakfast plate was very simple for its price. The most appetizing thing was the cereal French toast and the potatoes were good too. Ow3m9_aq9LTeYI7a9Lmmyw\n",
      "My boyfriend found this gem while browsing date night options for us! It's two restaurants combined so it gives it a very vastly huge look! Complimentary valet was a win! We were quickly seated and waited on. The live music was entertaining and relaxing. I ordered the MAC burger with fries and he got the fried chicken. Both entrees were delicious (huge portions though so we could barely finish it). Pretzels were the closest thing to heaven on earth (must always order those). I had the between you and me drink and he had a Manhattan... We each ordered 3 drinks a piece because they were that great. We will certainly return!!! Nailed it! K_LpTzp8S05BjMYVOhX1KA\n",
      "The server had a great attitude and was helpful in explaining the antipasti and refilling our drinks.\n",
      "Ordered the potato chips, cheese sliders and the Mac Burger.\n",
      "Potato chips were good, onion dip was ok, didn't taste like onions.\n",
      "Mac Burger is a good proximity of what that famous burger used to taste like when I was a kid and they were about the same size as this burger.\n",
      "Cheese sliders were awful!  These were late coming to a table, apology was given and we were told they would be taken care of.  The cost was still on our bill.  Ultimately, the biggest issue with the sliders is that they tasted like propane gas, no cheese or toast flavor.\n",
      "Would not go our of my way to eat here. 96MjHWvQIrRD9ytx9QzyFg\n",

      "I went with my new boss as a lunch outing to talk and get to know each other. The ambience was super cool. Wonderfully comfortable seating and they had a whole area dedicated to games like ping pong and bean bag toss. I want to go back just to enjoy some of that! They get kudos for the whole setup.\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to get the (what I considered expensive) roast beef au jus. Let me say, I do not know WTF they were thinking. First off, not enough meat, then they decided to butter the bread inside (wait for it...) and then put mayo along with onions and the beef. YACK, it was so greasy. I compare eating that to eating the nasty mayo-ey ultimate cheeseburger from Jack in the box. You end up not wanting to eat everything because the greasy mayo-ey mess is nauseating. To top it off, not enough fries either and to be honest I wish they offered a healthier side option because that was too much fattiness. \n",
      "\n",
      "I will go back and give them another try, but that sandwich alone put me off. I think I want to just go drink and play ping pong...sorry CD. yilu5Ot5gofxt30gemP01Q\n",

      "Atmosphere was cool. Food was ok. Server had an attitude. I had the MAC cheeseburger, it was alright. My kids had the mac and cheese with apples and my other boy had the chicken fingers with fries. I have to say, the mac and cheese was the best thing we all had. To be honest, for the $65 price for lunch for the four of us, we have had much better food and better experience.\n",

      "It's a basic American restaurant, but it's done WELL. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a mainstay of The Yard, you can opt for the raucous, outside seating. I opted for something a bit more dim. Intimate, even. It's man-cavey with all the sports playing, even if there's no sound. The bar has plenty of space, and is comfortable as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the appetizers (I swear I'll try those pretzels!) it is going to be sandwiches, burgers, and salads all the way down. Nothing really jumped out to me screaming \"try this!\" so I went with their Pub Burger. It was simple, but delicious and filling. I'd grab this again, but not before their salmon avocado toast or something like that. I need something more millennial to keep my Yelp-savvy superpowers, after all. \n",
      "\n",
      "You can wash anything down with the generous beer selection, or even the cool cocktail menu. La Vida Verde is cool, but probably just because I have a bias toward all things with jalapeno. Others, like \"Between you and Me\" with just vodka and grape juice are just plain lazy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I don't think you can really go wrong here. Service is nice, and the menu is capable of pleasing many picky eaters. For some reason, I am very partial to the atmosphere and will definitely be back with a couple friends. 8SOabJhCpXWGpGYeKcBHbg\n",
      "Ok, first of all, make sure you order your monkey bread 15-20 min before you consume. You're going to want to do it though because it is delicious. Second of all, be wary of the bathrooms because they're kind of confusing. All I'm saying is, you don't want to be buzzed and have to go to the bathroom because you'll most likely go in through the wrong door. And I feel like they did this on purpose for laughs. On to some actual food reviews though... my friend got the sweet corn ravioli, which unfortunately about 5 min after the waitress left, we were informed they didn't have any more left by the manager. It was fine, they gave her a cheddar mash ravioli, which she said was really good. They comped her meal for her. Two of my other friends got the club. It looked like a burger to me, so I was confused, but they said it was delicious! Another person on our table got the fish and chips. I have to tell you, I watched her pick up the first piece of chicken and it literally fell apart like butter! Finally, I got the fried chicken. Oh em gee. It was so good! It came with mashed potatoes, coleslaw, and a honey drizzled biscuit. It was like an upgraded version of a meal from kfc but it is exactly what I had been craving! All in all this place is good. Be aware since they are a scratch based restaurant, they may run out of what you are ordering. Also, the wait staff does tend to take a long time to come back and check on you so you may be there a while. wjbVZkwNFKCS_n15sLwFBw\n",

We asked our waiter if there was a place where it would be easier to talk, but he didn't think so.  He said there is a DJ there on Sundays starting at 12:30, so if we wanted to come when it was quieter, we could come between 11am and 12:30.\n",

      "Back to the food...the cheesesteak is crazy good!  Melt-in-your mouth, just the right amount of cheese, yummy au jus...best I've had anywhere.  Others in our party got the kale & sweet potato salad, ahi tuna salad, pub burger, and kids' meals with chicken fingers and mac and cheese.  Everyone said hands down that the food was incredible.  We all agreed, though, that we won't come back unless the loud music is toned down.  \n",

      "This a nice trendy happy hour spot. The food is delicious too. I have tried a couple of things here that I recommend. Top of the list is the Italian Grinder followed by the fried chicken and Mac burger. This place is great to meet up with friends or fun date nights. \n",

Chips and onion dip were a great side.   \n",
